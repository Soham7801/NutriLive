         <p><b>Minerals</b> are necessary for 3 main reasons, building strong bones and teeth, controlling body fluids inside and outside cells, turning the food you eat into energy.
             <br> The body needs many minerals; these are called essential minerals. A balanced diet usually provides all of the essential minerals. <br><b>There are two kinds of minerals:</b> <br>
             <ul>
                 <li> Macrominerals </li>
                 <li>Trace Minerals</li>
             </ul>
              You need larger amounts of macrominerals. They include calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, sodium, potassium, chloride and sulfur. You only need small amounts of trace minerals. They include iron, manganese, copper, iodine, zinc, cobalt, fluoride and selenium.
                Most people get the amount of minerals they need by eating a wide variety of foods. In some cases, your doctor may recommend a mineral supplement. People who have certain health problems or take some medicines may need to get less of one of the minerals. For example, people with chronic kidney disease need to limit foods that are high in potassium.
               Minerals are necessary for the normal functioning of the bodyâ€™s cells. The body needs relatively large quantities of, Calcium, Chloride, Magnesium, Phosphate, Potassium and Sodium. These minerals are called macrominerals. Bone, muscle, heart, and brain function depends on these minerals.
            <p>The body needs small quantities of chromium, copper, fluoride, iodine, iron, manganese, molybdenum, selenium and zinc. These minerals are called trace minerals. Except for chromium, all trace minerals are incorporated into enzymes or hormones required in body processes (metabolism). Chromium helps the body keep blood sugar levels normal. It is not clear whether chromium should be considered an essential (required) trace element. <br>Both macrominerals and trace minerals are harmful if too much is ingested. </p>
            <p> Consuming too little or too much of certain minerals can cause a nutritional disorder. People who eat a balanced diet containing a variety of foods are unlikely to develop a nutritional disorder or a major mineral deficiency, except sometimes for iodine, iron, or zinc. However, people who follow restrictive diets may not consume enough of a particular mineral (or vitamin). For example, vegetarians, including those who eat eggs and dairy products, are at risk of iron deficiency. Infants are more likely to develop deficiencies because they are growing rapidly (thus requiring larger amounts of nutrients for their size than adults).
