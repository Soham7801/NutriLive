         <p><b>Proteins</b>  are the building blocks of life. Every cell in the human body contains protein. The basic structure of a protein is a chain of amino acids.
            You need protein in your diet to help your body repair cells and make new ones. Protein is also important for growth and development in children, teens, and pregnant women. <br>Protein foods are broken down into parts called amino acids during digestion. The human body needs several amino acids in large enough amounts to maintain good health. You do not need to eat animal products to get all the protein you need in your diet.<br>
            <b>Amino acids are classified into three groups:</b> 
             <ul>
                <li><ins>Essential-</ins> <br>Essential amino acids cannot be made by the body and must be supplied by food. They do not need to be eaten at one meal. The balance over the whole day is more important.</li>
                <li><ins>Non-Essential-</ins> <br>Nonessential amino acids are made by the body from essential amino acids or in the normal breakdown of proteins.</li>
                <li><ins>Conditional-</ins> <br>Conditional amino acids are needed in times of illness and stress.</li>
             </ul>
            The amount of protein you need in your diet will depend on your overall calorie needs. The daily recommended intake of protein for healthy adults is 10% to 35% of your total calorie needs. For example, a person on a 2000 calorie diet could eat 100 grams of protein, which would supply 20% of their total daily calories.
            <br>One ounce (30 grams) of most protein-rich foods contains 7 grams of protein. An ounce (30 grams) equals: <br> (Children and teens may need different amounts, depending on their age.)
             <ul>
                 <li>1 oz (30 g) of meat fish or poultry                </li>

                 <li>½ cup (65 grams) cooked beans or lentils                </li>
             </ul>
            Some food sources of dietary protein include:
             <ul>
                 <li>lean meats – beef, lamb, veal, pork, kangaroo</li>
                 <li> poultry – chicken, turkey, duck, emu, goose, bush birds</li>

                 <li> nuts (including nut pastes) and seeds – almonds, pine nuts, walnuts, macadamias, hazelnuts, cashews, pumpkin seeds, sesame seeds, sunflower seeds</li>
                 <li> legumes and beans – all beans, lentils, chickpeas, split peas, tofu.</li>
                    
             </ul>
            Some grain and cereal-based products are also sources of protein but are generally not as high in protein as meat and meat alternative products.
