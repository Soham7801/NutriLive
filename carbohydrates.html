             <b>Carbohydrates</b> provide fuel for the central nervous system and energy for working muscles. They also prevent protein from being used as an energy source and enable fat metabolism, according to Iowa State University. 
             Also, "carbohydrates are important for brain function," Smathers said. They are an influence on "mood, memory, etc., as well as a quick energy source." In fact, the RDA of carbohydrates is based on the amount of carbs the brain needs to function.
         
         <br> Two recent studies published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences have also linked carbs to decision-making. In the studies, people who ate a high-carbohydrate breakfast were less willing to share when playing the "ultimatum game" than those who ate high-protein breakfasts. Scientists speculate this may be caused by baseline dopamine levels, which are higher after eating carbohydrates. This doesn't mean carbs make you mean, but underscores how different types of food intake can affect cognition and behavior. 
         <p> <b>Carbohydrates are classified as:</b> 
            <ul>
                <li>Simple </li>
                <li>Complex</li>
            </ul> 
             Smathers said. The difference between the two forms is the chemical structure and how quickly the sugar is absorbed and digested. Generally speaking, simple carbs are digested and absorbed more quickly and easily than complex carbohydrates. </p>
            <h3><ins> Simple carbohydrates</ins></h3>
            <p> Simple carbohydrates contain just one or two sugars, such as fructose (found in fruits) and galactose (found in milk products). These single sugars are called monosaccharides. Carbs with two sugars — such as sucrose (table sugar), lactose (from dairy) and maltose (found in beer and some vegetables) — are called disaccharides.
         Simple carbs are also in candy, soda and syrups. However, these foods are made with processed and refined sugars and do not have vitamins, minerals or fiber. They are called "empty calories" and can lead to weight gain.</p>
         <h3><ins> Complex carbohydrates (polysaccharides)</ins></h3>
         <p> Complex carbohydrates have three or more sugars. They are often referred to as starchy foods and include beans, peas, lentils, peanuts, potatoes, corn, parsnips, whole-grain breads and cereals.
         Smathers pointed out that, while all carbohydrates function as relatively quick energy sources, simple carbs cause bursts of energy much more quickly than complex carbs because of the quicker rate at which they are digested and absorbed. Simple carbs can lead to spikes in blood sugar levels and sugar highs, while complex carbs provide more sustained energy. <br>
         Studies have shown that replacing saturated fats with simple carbs, such as those in many processed foods, is associated with an increased risk of heart disease and type 2 diabetes. Smathers offered the following advice: "It's best to focus on getting primarily complex carbs in your diet, including whole grains and vegetables."  Carbohydrates are found in foods you know are good for you (vegetables) and ones you know are not (doughnuts). This has led to the idea that some carbs are "good" and some are "bad." According to Healthy Geezer Fred Cicetti, carbs commonly considered bad include pastries, sodas, highly processed foods, white rice, white bread and other white-flour foods. These are foods with simple carbs. Bad carbs rarely have any nutritional value. Carbs usually considered good are complex carbs, such as whole grains, fruits, vegetables, beans and legumes. These are not only processed more slowly, but they also contain a bounty of other nutrients. <br> <br> <br> The Pritikin Longevity Center offers this checklist for determining if a carbohydrate is "good" or "bad." <br>
            <h3><ins>Good carbs are:</ins></h3>
            <p><ol>
                <li>Low or moderate in calories </li>
                <li>High in nutrients</li>
                <li> Devoid of refined sugars and refined grains</li>
               <li> High in naturally occurring fiber</li>
               <li> Low in sodium</li>
               <li>Low in saturated fat</li>
               <li>Very low in, or devoid of, cholesterol and trans fats</li>
                   
            </ol></p>
            <h3><ins>Bad carbs are:</ins></h3>
            <p>
                <ol>
                   <li>High in calories </li>
                 <li>     Full of refined sugars, like corn syrup, white sugar, honey and fruit juices</li>
                 <li>     High in refined grains like white flour</li>
                 <li>      Low in many nutrients</li>
                 <li>      Low in fiber</li>
                 <li>     High in sodium</li>
                 <li>      Sometimes high in saturated fat</li>
                 <li>      Sometimes high in cholesterol and trans fats</li>
                    </li>
               </ol>
               Not getting enough carbs can cause problems. Without sufficient fuel, the body gets no energy. Additionally, without sufficient glucose, the central nervous system suffers, which may cause dizziness or mental and physical weakness, according to Iowa State University. A deficiency of glucose, or low blood sugar, is called hypoglycemia.
