         <p><b>Vitamins</b> are organic substances present in minute amounts in natural foodstuffs. Having too little of any particular vitamin may increase the risk of developing certain health issues. 
             A vitamin is an organic compound, which means that it contains carbon. It is also an essential nutrient that the body may need to get from food.
            <br> <b>There are currently 13 recognized vitamins.</b>
